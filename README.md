# sentaurus-Modeling-and-Simulation-of-130nm-N MOSFETs
This Project is a design to the N-MOSFET transistor using TCAD software Sentaurus SDE & Sdevice, with technology node 130nm.
Parameters used :
Metallurgical gate length (Channel Length) Lg 130nm
Gate Oxide thickness  t_ox 0.00289um
Substrate (Body) Depth sub_t 0.289um
Junction Depth xj 0.0867um 
The NMOSFET structure's is design on sde and then the electronic circuit analysis in both Ac and DC source supply is performed on s-decice tool and visualized by s-visual tool.
